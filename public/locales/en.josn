The design includes core components such as the Program Counter (PC), RAM, Instruction Register (IR), general-purpose registers A and B, an Adder/Subtractor ALU, Output Register, and a dedicated Control Unit. A custom control sequencer and instruction decoder were designed to generate precise control signals across multiple T-states. The architecture supports a complete instruction set including LDA, LDB, ADD, SUB, OUT, and HLT. Each instruction follows a structured fetch–execute cycle, verified through step-by-step clock-level simulation. The project demonstrates a clear understanding of digital control logic, micro-operations, instruction decoding, and datapath coordination in a basic CPU architecture.",

        "description": "This project presents a Bluetooth-controlled home lighting system designed and implemented using Arduino Uno as part of the Electronic System Design and Project course. The system allows users to remotely control multiple room lights (living room, bedroom, dining room, and balcony) using a smartphone-based Bluetooth controller application. Wireless communication is established through an HC-05 Bluetooth module, enabling real-time command transmission between the smartphone and the microcontroller.\n\nA Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor was integrated to intelligently manage the balcony light based on environmental lighting conditions. While indoor lights respond solely to user commands, the balcony light activates only when darkness is detected, even if the user issues an ON command—thereby ensuring energy-efficient operation. A global control feature was also implemented, allowing all lights to be turned ON or OFF simultaneously through a single command.\n\nThe system was powered using a 9V battery and assembled on a breadboard with appropriate resistors to regulate current flow. The Arduino firmware, developed using Arduino IDE, continuously monitors Bluetooth input data and LDR sensor values to execute conditional lighting logic. Experimental results demonstrated reliable wireless control, accurate light-intensity-based automation, and improved user convenience. The project successfully highlights the practical application of embedded systems, wireless communication, and sensor-based automation in smart home environments.",

        "description": "This project focuses on the design and implementation of a touchless automatic handwash dispenser aimed at improving hygiene and reducing the risk of cross-contamination, especially in public and healthcare environments. The system is built around an ATmega328P microcontroller, which processes distance measurements obtained from an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of hands beneath the dispenser.\n\nWhen a user places their hands within a predefined distance threshold, the ultrasonic sensor triggers the microcontroller to activate a servo motor. The servo motor precisely controls the dispensing mechanism, ensuring that a fixed and optimal amount of liquid soap is released each time. A predefined delay is implemented in the control logic to prevent excessive dispensing and reduce soap wastage.\n\nThe system is powered using a regulated 5V supply generated by a 7805 voltage regulator, ensuring stable and reliable operation. Supporting components such as capacitors, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, and USB-to-serial interfaces were used to configure and program the microcontroller as an Arduino-compatible system. Experimental results confirmed accurate hand detection, consistent soap dispensing, and improved hygiene through complete elimination of physical contact.",

Advanced preprocessing techniques such as resizing, green channel extraction, CLAHE, Gaussian filtering, normalization, and data augmentation were applied to enhance retinal features.

        "description": "This project presents an automated sleep stage classification framework using multimodal physiological signals, including EEG, EOG, and EMG, from the UCDDB dataset. Signals were band-pass filtered (0.5–48 Hz), resampled to 128 Hz, segmented into 30-second epochs, and normalized using Z-score normalization. Handcrafted time- and frequency-domain features were extracted from each modality. Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost classifiers were evaluated individually, where XGBoost consistently achieved superior performance across all signals. A soft-voting ensemble of EEG-, EOG-, and EMG-based XGBoost models was then developed to exploit complementary modality information. The proposed ensemble achieved an overall accuracy of 89.47% and ROC-AUC of 0.99, demonstrating strong robustness and suitability for clinical sleep analysis.",
